Simple syntax highlighter based on PrismJS

== Description ==


== Installation ==

Download the zip file and add a new plugin in WordPress
Aibhsitheoir modifies the default behaviour of Prism-JS slightly: it will only highlight code in the format:

<pre><code class="language-cpp">
//your code here
</code></pre>
Unlike the default Prism-JS behaviour, Aibhsitheoir does not add a class to the enclosing <pre> tag.
